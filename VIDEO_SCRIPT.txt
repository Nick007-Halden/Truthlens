Intro (0:00-0:10)

Demo (0:40-1:40)
- Show the website at http://localhost:8000
- Paste the pre-filled claim and click Analyze. Explain the verdict, show micro-lesson.
- Upload the file named 'kerala2018.jpg' (or a sample image) and show PastCheck output.

Architecture (1:40-2:30)
- Mention this is a prototype using a seeded corpus (factchecks.json).
- For production, integrate Vertex AI Gemini, Vertex Search, and a reverse-image index (see BACKEND_NOTES.md).

Closing (2:30-3:00)
- Impact and next steps: explainability, scaling, browser extension (TruthLens overlay).
